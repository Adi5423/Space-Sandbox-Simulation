SPACE SIMULATION ENGINE DOCUMENTATION
====================================

1. OVERVIEW
-----------
The Space Simulation Engine is a sophisticated physics-based simulation system that models celestial bodies and their interactions in space. The engine combines modern graphics rendering with accurate physics calculations to create an immersive space simulation experience.

2. CORE COMPONENTS
-----------------
2.1 Engine Backend
-----------------
The engine backend (EngineBackend.cpp) provides the fundamental infrastructure:
- Logger: Thread-safe logging system with multiple log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, FATAL)
- Cache: Generic caching system with multiple policies (LRU, LFU, FIFO)
- FileSystem: Handles file operations with error handling
- ThreadPool: Manages concurrent operations
- EventSystem: Implements event-driven architecture
- ErrorHandler: Centralized error management
- ConfigurationManager: Handles engine configuration

2.2 Rendering System
-------------------
The rendering system (Renderer.cpp) is built on OpenGL and provides:
- Modern OpenGL (3.3+) rendering pipeline
- Shader-based rendering with vertex and fragment shaders
- Depth testing for proper 3D rendering
- Grid system for spatial reference
- Text rendering for UI elements
- Camera system with view and projection matrices
- Mesh rendering with model transformations

2.3 Physics Simulation
---------------------
The simulator (Simulator.cpp) implements:
- Newtonian gravitational physics
- N-body problem solution
- Velocity Verlet integration
- Force calculations between celestial bodies
- Position and velocity updates
- Time-step based simulation

3. ALGORITHMS AND METHODS
------------------------
3.1 Physics Calculations
------------------------
- Gravitational Force: F = G * (m1 * m2) / r²
- Acceleration: a = F / m
- Velocity Update: v = v + a * dt
- Position Update: p = p + v * dt

3.2 Rendering Pipeline
---------------------
1. Clear buffers
2. Update view and projection matrices
3. Apply shader program
4. Set uniform variables
5. Render meshes with transformations
6. Render UI elements
7. Swap buffers

3.3 Caching Strategies
---------------------
- LRU (Least Recently Used): Removes least recently accessed items
- LFU (Least Frequently Used): Removes least frequently accessed items
- FIFO (First In First Out): Removes oldest items

4. DATA STRUCTURES
-----------------
4.1 Core Structures
------------------
- Vector: 3D vector for positions, velocities, and forces
- Body: Represents celestial bodies with mass, position, velocity
- Mesh: 3D model data with vertices and indices
