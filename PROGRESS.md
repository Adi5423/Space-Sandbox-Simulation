# Project Progress

## Project Overview
AstroSandbox is a 3D space simulation project that aims to provide an interactive environment for visualizing and experimenting with space physics concepts. The project uses OpenGL for rendering and implements a custom physics engine for space simulations.

## Demo Video
Check out the [Coordinate System Demo](demo_samples/Coordinate%20System%20Demo.mp4) to see the current implementation in action.
